<font color="#fff"> AI art is art that is produced digitally with the assistance of artificial intelligence. Harold Cohen created the AARON which was a turtle system that drew black-and-white drawings. Later versions allowed for more complex drawings and even coloring. The AARON system drew without the assistance of humans and this allowed for innovations to improve on the AARON system. Since its creation, many companies including Google have released their own AI software that allows anyone to create art out of nothing. This is also an incredibly simple process to use AI. </font color> </li>

<li><a href="https://zapier.com/blog/ai-art-generator/"> Which AI Generator is the best? </a></li>
<font color="#fff"> As mentioned before, AI allows people to create art through a very simple process. You type in a text prompt into a generator and out comes art. What separates AI programs from each other if they all do the same? Different levels of comprehension and software ability. It is stated on Zapier that AI algorithms are trained on billions of text-pairs and this helps with word combinations to allow the generator to create a new image. Currently, there are two models used to render images and that is diffusion models and Generative Adversarial Networks. </font color>
