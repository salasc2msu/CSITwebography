<li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-drawing-tablets/"> Best Drawing Tablets </a></li>
<font color="#fff"> In this link, Wirecutter goes through the best drawing tablets that are out now. What they believe to be the best tablet is the Huion Inspiroy 2M because of the amount of space there is to draw on. Even though the stylus is wireless, there is no latency as well so there will be no lag when drawing, thus allowing for a smooth experience. It does not have wireless support, although there are several hotkeys to be able to customize the program it uses to allow for the most comfortable drawing experience, which is convenient because the tablet is also comfortable to hold.</font color> </li>

<li><a href="https://medium.com/@bleeskylar/graphic-tablet-ae9752ddad7a"> History of the Art Tablet </a></li>
<font color="#fff"> In this link, we take a look at the history of the art tablet and how it has evolved in recent times. The first digital drawing tablet was the RAND tablet, This was the first graphics tablet that allowed actual real time handwriting to be projected onto a screen while writing on the tablet.. It did so by connecting a display to a writing surface and receiving information to determine the position of the stylus. Since then, many tablets have come out until most recently the Wacom Cintiq Pro and the iPad Pro, which both boast power that has not been since in a drawing tablet before. </font color>
