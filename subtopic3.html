<font color="#fff"> One form of creating art that is groundbreaking and recent is 3D printing. The first 3D printer was made by Dr. Hideo Kodama in 1981(Chapman, 2023). This was done by combining a resin with UV lights. Although the earliest prototype created was in 1981, 3D printers did not become commercially available until 2006. The first of these was the RepRap. One of the fascinating things about the RepRap is that it was created with plastic parts that can be 3D printed. In other words, one can purchase a RepRap and create other 3D printers with the RepRap alone (Chapman, 2023). As the desire for 3D printing grows, the capabilities also grow as well, due to innovations that add quality of life improvements, making 3D printing more efficient and reliable. </font color> </li>

<li><a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/best-3d-printer/"> Which 3D Printer is the best? </a></li>
<font color="#fff"> In this link, CNET goes through many different 3D printers for different occasions that use different materials. The important thing to look out for when looking for a 3D printer is knowing what type of things you want to print. Different 3D printers have different purposes and capabilities for the application it is being used for. Overall, the best 3D Printer out now is the Bambu Lab P1S because of the quality and speed it contains, which is something not a lot printers can match at the same price point. </font color> </li>
